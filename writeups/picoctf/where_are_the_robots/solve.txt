With this description:
Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474

Asked me to find the robots. Robots.txt is where a web site can tell search engines what pages to not look at and index. It can be found here:
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/robots.txt

The contents of the robots.txt shows to not index /477ce.html
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html

Here is the page where the flag can be found:
